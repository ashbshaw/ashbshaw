I'm Ashley, a Test  Engineer who likes to solve problems, document helpful information, and encourage team collaboration. Welcome to my GitHub profile. It's mostly filled with learning experiments, as I am not a full-time developer.

âš¡ Fun fact: when I am not at work, you can find me running trails in the woods.<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hyunsukim/">
